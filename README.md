# ML-based-Breast-Radiation-Dosimetry-in-CT
## Description

The aim of this project was to develop an automated machine-learning workflow for rapid and accurate personalized breast radiation dosimetry in CT imaging. The pipeline integrates breast segmentation models with a breast dose prediction deep neural network. The segmentation models were created using the [nnU-Net framework](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet), while the dose prediction DNN was developed in PyTorch.

This repository provides open-source access to the trained machine learning models. Additionally, users can reproduce the validation results from this project using the provided inference notebooks or by launching the following Colab notebook:

Created at the Department of Medical Physics, School of Medicine, University of Crete.
