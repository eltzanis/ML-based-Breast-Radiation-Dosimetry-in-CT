# ML-based-Breast-Radiation-Dosimetry-in-CT
## Description

The aim of this project was to develop an automated machine-learning workflow for rapid and accurate personalized breast radiation dosimetry in CT imaging. The pipeline integrates breast segmentation models with a breast dose prediction deep neural network. The segmentation models were created using the [nnU-Net framework](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet), while the dose prediction DNN was developed in PyTorch.

This repository provides open-source access to the trained machine learning models. Additionally, users can reproduce the validation results from this project using the provided inference notebooks or by launching the following Colab notebook: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1r62nkihyan_C6HVDRYFf9Agx1FCkJAsG?usp=sharing)
